# Julia Tutorial

This is a tutorial for [Julia programming
language](http://julialang.org/).  Though [the official manual of
Julia](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/) is well written, it is
not quite suitable for first-time learners, at least in my opinion.
The tutorial is primarily written for newbies in a step-by-step
fashion and contains the basics of Julia.  However, more advanced
topics will be added when this tutorial reach a certain length.  And I
hope more people who are interested in Julia for technical computing
and want to contribute will help me complete this tutorial together.
