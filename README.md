# Julia Tutorial #

[This tutorial](https://github.com/SimonQijieZhao/JuliaTutorial/blob/master/JuliaTutorial.md)
is for [Julia programming language](http://julialang.org/).  Though
[the official manual of Julia](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/)
is well written, it is not quite suitable for newbies to grasp the
basics of Julia in a short time, at least in my opinion.  From the
perspective of first-time learners, in this tutorial, I put together
and re-organise all the necessities for learning Julia, so that the
reading would go more smoothly, without jumping back and forth
different sections of other materials before understanding the context
at hand.


Currently it contains the basics of Julia.  However, more advanced
topics will be added when this tutorial reach a certain length.  And I
hope more people who are interested in Julia for technical computing
and want to contribute will help me improve this tutorial together.
